**Summary:** Cancer arises through DNA mutations in the genome. As populations of cancer cells divide, they continue to mutate and pass on their mutations to their daughter cells. Subpopulations of similar cells (called clones) can be identified by the proportions of mutations from bulk-sequenced tissue. Tracking these clones allows us to obtain valuable information about the tumourâ€™s evolution. For example, we may identify mutations in certain clones that may confer resistance to particular treatments, allowing us to target treatment most effectively. Most approaches that identify clones look at single-nucleotide mutations, which are the most common mutation type we observe in cancers. Large rearrangements of DNA, called structural variation (SV), also occur and can have significant effects on the tumour genome, however, currently we lack approaches to characterise the SVs specific to certain clones. To address this, we developed a probabilistic model, called SVclone, that takes the SVs we have detected in our tumour sequencing sample and uses this information to identify clones. We applied our approach to a cohort of over 2,600 sequenced tumour samples across 38 tumour types and found distinct patterns across different cancer types. We identified one particular subset of samples with clones containing a characteristic set of rearrangements. Patients with these clones had reduced overall survival, suggesting that finding patterns such as this may help identify clinically relevant subtypes of cancers, ultimately leading to better monitoring and treatment.
