    "## The issue with perfect phylogenies\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, I wrote [a blog post](https://genomejigsaw.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/building-phylogenetic-trees-with-binary-traits/), exploring the _Gusfield algorithm_ for building phylogenetic trees from binary traits. While the algorithm works well if you happen to have a clean matrix that just-so happes to form a perfect phylogeny, if you experiment with different matrix permutations of 1s and 0s, you'll quickly find that matrices which create perfect phylogenies are scarce. In fact, if there are any pairs of columns \\[C1,C2\\] that have the values \\[0,1\\], \\[1,0\\] and \\[1,1\\], then a perfect phylogeny cannot be built. Imperfect data sources and noisy data can contribute to the difficulties of building a valid phylogeny. To allow for some slack for running the phylogeny-finding algorithm, one option is to use the _imperfect phylogeny algorithm_, which is described (and implemented in near-linear time) in a [paper by Pe'er et al.](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0097539702406510) (pay-walled, unfortunately). I will explain and implement this algorithm in code in this post. If you're after the mathematical proofs or description, refer to the original paper, or [this far-more digestable explanation](http://carolineuhler.com/paperCS.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "## A motivation for using the imperfect phylogeny algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In modelling phylogenetic trees from binary data, it is unlikely that you'll have absolute certainty in observing data values. In my early experiments of my PhD project, I was utilising the Gusfield algorithm for [structural variation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/content/overview/) data in multiple samples of the same cancer patient. In my case, observing the same structural variation across several tumour samples of the same patient gave me high confidence that the variation existed. However, I was much less confident when I did _not_ see variant in one patient sample, when it was clearly in others. Thus, my '1's were certain, but my '0's were uncertain. In my case, there were several reasons why we might not see a variant in a particular sample (maybe the [depth of coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sequencing) was too low, or the sample had a lot of normal tissue contamination). In this case, I could mark the rows of my low-quality samples with 'incomplete' or unknown values where SVs were not found. This strategy allowed me to find valid phylogenies where previously they eluded me."

    "## The incomplete phylogeny problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In our feature matrix, we now allow a third feature type - unknown or incomplete, denoted by '?'. Hence our values can be 0, 1 or ? for any cell. The incomplete phylogeny algorithm will then infer the unknown values by determining whether the sample belongs to the 'clade' associated with the feature - the clade being the evolutionary group with a common ancestor, that the sample/species evolved from. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm will output a perfect phylogeny tree $T$ (if present), as well as the corresponding completed matrix $M$. The algorithm is composed of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove any columns in our matrix $M$_ with no 0s or all 0s.\n",
    "2. Construct a graph where 1s represent edges between features (columns) and samples (rows).\n",
    "3. Get each set of connections where there are >1 connections (call these _K_) in the graph $G$, for each _K_ (while $G \\neq \\emptyset$):\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. get all the samples ($S$ or rows) in $K$, call this $S'$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii. for this set of $S'$, get all the features ($C$ or columns) where there are no 0 entries, call this $U$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    iii. if there are no elements in $U$, stop.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    iv. otherwise remove $U$ from the graph $G$ (also removing any connections), and add $S'$ to our tree $T$.\n",
    "       \n",
    "4. For any $C$s that are _associated_ with the clade $S$ (a group is $S$s), set these to 1, otherwise 0.\n",
    "5. Return $T$ and $M'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the algoprithm, Let's work from the following matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "|    | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 |\n",
    "|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n",
    "| S1 | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | ?  |\n",

    "| S3 | 1  | ?  | 0  | 0  | 1  |\n",
    "| S4 | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | ?  |\n",
    "| S5 | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | ?  |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now transform this matrix into a graph, creating connections between the nodes, $C$s and $S$s. Edges are defined where $C$ and $S$ share a value of '1'. To do this, we first code up an graph implementation, with nodes and edges. One approach can be found [here](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/cs22-lbcc/Graphs/graphintro.html) - the base graph code, as well as the $M$ Graph implementation are in the mgraph.py file in this repository."
